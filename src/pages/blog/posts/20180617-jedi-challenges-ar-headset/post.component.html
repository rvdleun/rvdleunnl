<p>Here's a deep and dark secret I've been trying to hide for all my life: I'm a big Star Wars fan.</p>
<p>It started out so simple and innocent. There was this game I played called TIE Fighter, and it was all about this big Empire thing that was just trying to bring order to a chaotic galaxy. And then I spent months begging my parents to get me this Doom-like shooter called Dark Forces. And... well, before you know it, you're flying X-Wings against the Empire you first were protecting, ordering troops around in Force Commander, and learning the ways of the Force in Jedi Knight. And then you learn that there is this huge connected universe of novels, RPGs and comics and all seems lost.</p>
<p>They had even made movies. Can you believe that?</p>
<p>That was years ago though. While I would say that I am still a big fan of Star Wars, I would like to think that I've made it a less higher priority in my life. Still, when I saw an advertisement about Jedi Challenges, I knew that I would want it soon enough.</p>

<h3>Jedi Challenges</h3>
<app-youtube id="HX7X3TvjXNc"></app-youtube>
<p>So yeah, it's a Star Wars Augmented Reality experience. While I am more interested in VR, I really wanted to try this out, but it was pretty expensive at the time. Luckily, I managed to get a used copy for about 50% that was in a really good state.</p>
<p>I seriously wasn't expecting too much, but the whole thing is better than I expected. As you can see from the video, it's powered by the mobile. You put your phone in a container, and place it in the AR Headset. The result is that the display is mirrored onto the helmet itself, giving an Augmented Reality-like experience. The two cameras in the headset itself are able to track the beacon to determine your position. While it <span class="italic">IS</span> jittery, the fact that you can see the environment around you ensures that you don't get sick.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves: The Lightsaber battles are easily the best. You get indications on how to hold your weapon to block attacks and get cues on when to attack. While it starts off simply with Maul, the difficulty rate slowly goes up and you'll find yourself dodging and rotating the saber to block a flurry of attacks. I've only finished the first tier so far, and already having issues with the later stages. For what sorta looks like a novelty, cash-in title, it is surprisingly challenging.</p>
<p>The other modes are, overall, pretty well done as well, although they feel more like extras. Haven't done much with the chess mini-game, but the strategy game feels really cool with a holographic display of the battlefield. While it feels a bit odd to give commands with a lightsaber, it is a surprisingly good package.</p>
<p>I've also found it to be a good demo to bring to meetups. It's all mobile, easily fitting within a bag. And with the tracking beacon in there, it gives a good demonstration on how a Room Scale experience works. In fact, I would say that the AR doesn't add too much to the game. You never really feel as if Darth Vader is right there in the living room, and you quickly tend to forget about the environment as it is and focus more on the game itself.</p>
<p>Still, here's another confession: I didn't get this just for the game. First off, I wanted a Lightsaber prop in my office and I was told that the controller is a surprisingly good replica. Which, in my opinion, it is. But I accelerated my plans to get one when I saw the following video...</p>

<h3>History repeating itself</h3>
<app-youtube caption="Video courtesy of Nathan Butler" id="s_CVJPP5_CQ"></app-youtube>
<p>This video shows what actually happens on your mobile while it is in the headset. And I quickly noticed that it was obvious that the black background is likely the transparent part that isn't shown by the user. So this got me wondering if it would be possible to develop applications for this headset by simply showing a 3D scene on a black background. I couldn't find any documentation or SDK online on how to build for this headset(more about that later), aside from people asking if one is available.</p>
<p>You see, I am a big fan of the Google Cardboard concept. When I didn't want to spend the money on an Oculus Development Kit, the <a href="https://www.durovis.com/nl/product.html?id=1">Durovis Dive</a> let me take my first steps in learning how to develop for Virtual Reality. Yes, it doesn't get any close to what the Rift or Vive offers, and I knew that, but it was enough to spark my imagination.</p>
<p>And history is repeating itself here. While I would love to have a Hololens at home(I've tried it, and it's just incredible technology), I simply can't afford one. So I was hoping to see if I could already start working on little AR prototypes and concepts with this headset.</p>
<p>I won't beat around the bush: I wouldn't be writing this article if I wasn't able to get something working. Still, it was a bit of a challenge. Here's how I managed to get it to work.</p>
