<h3>On why I started this blog</h3>
<p>So this blog has been coming for some time. I recently managed to get ownership of rvdleun.com and .nl again. A few years ago, I had them, but did very little with the website, so I dropped it. Someone else took it over for awhile, turned it into a webshop for running shoes(of all things). Now that I have ownership of this domain again, I want to make use of it again.</p>
<p>I just checked, and the last time I lost the rvdleun.nl subdomain was on the 28th of March, 2015, so just about three years ago. In that time, a lot has changed for me. About two months later, I started out as a freelancer(something that I'll likely blog about), went from being a PHP Developer to broadening out more to front-end development via Angular, started to use frameworks that I used as a hobby up to that point for professional(or: paying) projects, and was able to turn a VR passion into something useful.</p>
<p>In that time, I've also surprised myself into becoming not only comfortable of speaking in front of a crowd, but genuinely enjoying it.</p>
<p>Most of all, the last six months have been pretty hectic for me, but also very rewarding. Among things, I have(in no particular order)...
<ul>
    <li>started to dip into open-source development and offering pull requests for frameworks</li>
    <li>started to experiment with ARCore</li>
    <li>started playing around with AI services like IBM Watson and Microsoft LUIS</li>
    <li>become proficient with Test-Driven Development</li>
    <li>moved to a new house which now has an actual office with an 2.5x2.5 area permanently reserved for the HTC Vive as room-space</li>
    <li>done some good old-fashioned hacking again with external controllers(like a Guitar Hero controller) and AR Headsets</li>
    <li>gave my first VR talk at a conference(Fronteers) which was an awesome experience</li>
    <li>officially became a co-founder of the Reality Lab, a startup focused on awesome VR projects</li>
    <li>learn the ins and outs of being a Lead Developer to properly guide a team</li>
    <li>done quite a bit more that I am likely forgetting...</li>
</ul>
<p>Summed up, cool stuff is happening and I want to journal some of it. Gather my thoughts, present them and hopefully get some feedback as well.</p>

<h3>Some brief thoughts about becoming a freelancer</h3>
<p>I'm also releasing this site on the third anniversary of me becoming a freelancer. It had always been one of those dreams I had while starting out. With the full support of my wife and the help of some good friends, I started out with a couple of small projects, but soon got a first big project to work on an Ionic application.</p>
<p>That project is basically what made me realise that I could use a lot of knowledge I had learned in my spare time and actually use it in my career. Up to that point, I had generally been a PHP Developer and had only been working on PHP projects. Now, I have nothing against PHP(and still work with it), but I also wanted to do more with front-end. In my spare time, I had been learning to work with Angular, Ionic, Unity and the like, and I only ever really used those for personal projects, but just never got an opportunity with the companies that I work for.</p>
<p>(this is not a slight against my former employers. I was hired as a PHP Developer, so I can understand why they'd want me to focus on that)</p>
<p>If there ever was a reason to become a freelancer, I'd say that is the main one for me. Yes, I'm a nerd. I like tinkering and learning new frameworks and development techniques. But now I can use that knowledge during my day job and pick up new things on the way. This has also allowed me to work with technology that had really only been a hobby for me up to that point. I've gotten to work with AR and VR solutions, started working with Microsoft Bot Framework, basically just doing a lot of stuff that I think is incredibly cool.</p>
<p>I will admit that it can become very stressful at times, with possibly taking on a bit too many projects(but it's just so much fun), making sure that all invoices have been sent out and the like. But it has also offered me a serious amount of freedom to do what I like to do during my day job.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't think I'd want to trade that for anything at the moment.</p>
