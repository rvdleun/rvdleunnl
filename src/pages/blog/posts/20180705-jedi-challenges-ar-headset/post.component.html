<p>Here's a deep and dark secret I've been trying to hide for all my life: I'm a big Star Wars fan.</p>
<p>It started out so simple and innocent. There was this game I played called TIE Fighter, and it was all about this big Empire thing that was just trying to bring order to a chaotic galaxy. And then I spent months begging my parents to get me this Doom-like shooter called Dark Forces. And... well, before you know it, you're flying X-Wings against the Empire you first were protecting, ordering troops around in Force Commander, and learning the ways of the Force in Jedi Knight. And then you learn that there is this huge connected universe of novels, RPGs and comics and all seems lost.</p>
<p>There were even movies. Can you believe it?</p>
<p>That was years ago though. While I would say that I am still a big fan of Star Wars, I would like to think that I've made it a less higher priority in my life. Still, when I saw an advertisement about Jedi Challenges, I knew that I would want to get it as soon as I could.</p>

<h3>Jedi Challenges</h3>
<app-youtube id="HX7X3TvjXNc"></app-youtube>
<p>So yeah, it's a Star Wars Augmented Reality experience. While I am more interested in VR, I really wanted to try this out, but it was pretty expensive at the time. Luckily, I managed to get a used copy that was in a really good state.</p>
<p>I seriously wasn't expecting too much, but the whole thing is better than I expected. As you can see from the video, it's powered by the mobile. You put your phone in a container, and place it in the AR Headset. The result is that the display is mirrored onto the helmet itself, giving an Augmented Reality-like experience. The two cameras in the headset itself are able to track the beacon to determine your position. While it <span class="italic">IS</span> jittery, the fact that you can see the environment around you ensures that you don't get sick.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves: The Lightsaber battles are easily the best. You get indications on how to hold your weapon to block attacks and get cues on when to attack. While it starts off simply with Maul, the difficulty rate slowly goes up and you'll find yourself dodging and rotating the saber to block a flurry of attacks. I've only finished the first tier so far, and already having issues with the later stages. For what sorta looks like a novelty, cash-in title, it is surprisingly challenging.</p>
<p>The other modes are, overall, pretty well done as well, although they feel more like extras. Haven't done much with the chess mini-game, but the strategy game feels really cool with a holographic display of the battlefield. While it feels a bit odd to give commands with a lightsaber, it is a surprisingly good package.</p>
<p>I've also found it to be a good demo to bring to meetups. It's all mobile, easily fitting within a bag. And with the tracking beacon in there, it gives a good demonstration on how a Room Scale experience works. In fact, I would say that the AR doesn't add too much to the game. You never really feel as if Darth Vader is right there in the living room, and you quickly tend to forget about the environment as it is and focus more on the game itself.</p>
<p>Still, here's another confession: I didn't get this just for the game. First off, I wanted a Lightsaber prop in my office and I was told that the controller is a surprisingly good replica. Which, in my opinion, it is. But I accelerated my plans to get one when I saw the following video...</p>

<h3>History repeating itself</h3>
<app-youtube caption="Video courtesy of Nathan Butler" id="s_CVJPP5_CQ"></app-youtube>
<p>This video shows what actually happens on your mobile while it is in the headset. And I quickly noticed that it was obvious that the black background is likely the transparent part that isn't shown by the user. So this got me wondering if it would be possible to develop applications for this headset by simply showing a 3D scene on a black background. I couldn't find any documentation or SDK online on how to build for this headset(more about that later), aside from people asking if one is available.</p>
<p>You see, I am a big fan of the Google Cardboard concept. When I didn't want to spend the money on an Oculus Development Kit, the <a href="https://www.durovis.com/nl/product.html?id=1">Durovis Dive</a> let me take my first steps in learning how to develop for Virtual Reality. Yes, it doesn't get any close to what the Rift or Vive offers, and I knew that, but it was enough to spark my imagination.</p>
<p>And history is repeating itself here. While I would love to have a Hololens at home(I've tried it, and it's just incredible technology), I simply can't afford one. So I was hoping to see if I could already start working on little AR prototypes and concepts with this headset.</p>
<p>I won't beat around the bush: I wouldn't be writing this article if I wasn't able to get something working. Still, it was a bit of a challenge. Here's how I managed to get it to work.</p>

<h3>The AR Template</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/blog/lenovo-ar-headset/step-2-stereo-effect.jpg" />
<app-caption content="The final template showing a galaxy in your living room"></app-caption>
<p>I started writing about the technical details on how I got the template to work, but I decided to finish writing all that for another post. It just got too technical, and frankly, I would like to start out with some background details.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the canvas object only takes up a small part of the scene. This is the only part that gets mirrored on the headset. It's also rendered as a stereo-effect for each eye. As mentioned in the above paragraph, everything that is black will be transparent. It works like a charm.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things other things I should mention...</p>
<ul>
    <li>You will need to run the page in full-screen mode. There is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json">manifest.json</a> file which lets you create a bookmark on an Android device. After pressing it, the page will appear without the URL bar.</li>
    <li>I'm using <a href="https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js">NoSleep.js</a> to make sure that the screen doesn't go to sleep. After putting the device in the holder, you can't do any interaction with the mobile, so this is an easy way to keep it running.</li>
    <li>The screen needs to be set to vertical mode. I tried to get this working via the manifest.json, but wasn't able to. Easiest way to do it is to put your device in landscape mode and then lock the orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using those few steps, you can build an AFrame project and get it running on a Lenovo headset. I will ollow up this post with a more technical one, where I will also post a link to a Github repository with a template.</p>

<h3>What have I built with this?</h3>
<p>Here's two projects that I've created with this.</p>

<h4>Presentation notes</h4>
<img src="/assets/img/blog/lenovo-ar-headset/presentation-notes.jpg" />
<app-caption content="Showing the notes from the current presentation slide"></app-caption>
<p>This is actually one of the things I had wanted to build as a prototype for the Vuzix when I worked at AR Development, but unfortunately, never took the opportunity.</p>
<p>I've given a few talks by now, and what I would like is for my presentation notes to be presented in front of me during the talk and synced to the slides. Using reveal.js and socket.io, I built a simple webapp that allows me to see those notes while wearing the AR Headset. I'm not even using AFrame here, but pure HTML to render the text.</p>
<p>Practical with a device like the Lenovo? Most likely not. But it's still an experience I want to try out at a meetup at some point and I have to admit that it actually felt pretty cool when training for a talk at home. I had hoped to use this application for a talk at <a href="https://www.roledrinks.com/">role=drinks</a>, but I unfortunately had to cancel at the last moment for personal reasons.</p>
<p>Still, if I can get the chance to give a talk at an informal meetup, I'll definitely see if I can use this.</p>

<h4>AFrame scene previewer</h4>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So here&#39;s a fun little morning excercise.<br><br>I&#39;ve ported my <a href="https://twitter.com/aframevr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@aframevr</a> live-demo viewer to the <a href="https://twitter.com/lenovo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@lenovo</a> headset that comes with Jedi Challenges. I can now edit a scene, and directly see the results by looking aside.<br><br>Honestly, this is the sort of thing that I wanna see in the future. <a href="https://t.co/koqLqNK6Tq">pic.twitter.com/koqLqNK6Tq</a></p>&mdash; Ruben van der Leun (@rvdleun) <a href="https://twitter.com/rvdleun/status/984695845856665600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2018</a></blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty good example of me wanting to use this headset for somethimg more practical and to get a preview on how I imagine 3D will be built and modelled in the future.</p>
<p>To accommodate the WebVR-related talks, I've developed a simple webapp that will update an A-Scene live by keeping the HTML in sync with a Firebase database. For this prototype, I've gone with a more advanced version that keeps an eye on the HTML files on my computer, and if they're updated, it will automatically update the a-scene without refreshing the page. Again, this was accomplished with node.js</p>
<p>What this means is that I can develop an AFrame project in my IDE, and while wearing the Lenovo headset, see the results happen in real-time to my right. I suppose this is one of those "Have to try it to believe it" things, but for me, this really makes building an AFrame scene so much easier. Instead of making a guess while looking at a screen or taking the time to wear/remove the headset, I can just instantly see the results, make a change in the HTML, save, and instantly see the results. I get a far better insight in what I'm building when seeing it being projected right in front of me, while still being able to code on my computer.</p>


<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<p>In conclusion, I want to share some final thoughts on this...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any support for positional tracking or making use of the lightsaber? <strong>None.</strong></li>
    <li>Is it practical? <strong>No.</strong></li>
    <li>Could you see this being used seriously in a professional way? <strong>Nope.</strong></li>
    <li>Will it let you prototype AR ideas? <strong>Oh yeah!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And you know what? That last thing really makes the trouble worth it.</p>
